		<h2>Chapli-Kabab Recipe</h2>
		<h1>WHAT IS CHAPLI KABAB?</h1>
		<p>
			Chapli kabab are thin ground beef patties made with aromatics and spices. Unlike your usual grilled kebabs, Chapli Kabab are fried so theyâ€™re browned on the outside and tender on the inside.
			Chapli Kabab have a unique flavor, with ingredients like dried pomegranate seeds (anardana) to lend them a slight tang and coarsely ground coriander to enhance their already crispy exterior.
			Originally a delicacy around the Afghanistan and Pakistan frontier, they are now a popular street food and restaurant favorite.

		<h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
		<p>Only two of the required ingredients warrant a trip to the Desi Grocery Store:<br> Dried Pomegranate seeds (Anardana) Corn Flour (Makki ka atta) or Gram flour (Besan)</p>

		<h1>HOW TO MAKE CHAPLI KABAB</h1>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Toast & grind the spices.</b>Toasting deepens the flavor while removing the raw taste of the spices. Add them to a spice grinder (or even a food processor) along with the pomegranate seeds. Roughly crush.</li>
			<li><b>Toast the corn flour or gram flour.</b> Again, enhances the nutty flavor of the corn flour. You can probably get away with not toasting, but I toast. It takes 5 minutes. You can do it. Or not. Follow your heart on this one.</li>
			<li><b>Combine all the ingredients</b> in a bowl, including the prepped ones above.</li>
			<li><b>Mix/knead the dough</b>vigorously until you can see the stringy texture of the meat. You can also use the paddle attachment of a stand mixer to do this.</li>
			<li><b>Fry!</b>There are 2 ways to do this. The first one is obvious. Shape into patties. But, if you can, smash them directly on the pan.</li>
		</ul>
