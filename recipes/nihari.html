		<h2>Nihari Recipe</h2>
		<h1>WHAT IS NIHARI?</h1>
		<p>
			Nihari is a rich, slow-cooked meat stew flavored with spices and thickened with atta, or Pakistani & Indian-style durum whole wheat flour. Pakistani versions of Nihari are typically made with beef, but Nihari can be made with lamb, goat meat, or chicken.
			<br>The word “nihari” comes from the root Arabic word “nahar”, meaning “day” or “morning”. <br>This dish is called Nihari because originally, it was eaten in the morning. The history suggests that it started in Old Delhi, where it was eaten by Mughal nawabs and workmen to fuel them throughout the day.

		<h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
		<p>Other than an unapologetically long list of spices, Nihari requires simple ingredients commonly found in Pakistani cuisine:</p>

		<p>Traditionally, atta flour, which is typically used to make rotis, is added to thicken the curry. I highly recommend you use this for an authentic taste.
			<br>This recipe requires either store-bought or homemade Nihari Masala Powder (recipe below!) along with a few other whole & ground spices.</p>

		<h1>HOW TO MAKE NIHARI</h1>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Step 1: Brown the onions & meat.</b> Deeply brown onions (refer to the video rather than the pic for reference) give flavor, body, and depth to Nihari. Like with most stews, searing the meat so that it browns is essential, but don’t sear for too long as it can lead to tough meat.</li>
			<li><b>Step 2: Bloom Spices. </b> Add spices and allow them to cook in the hot oil. If you’re worried about them burning, you can always add a splash of water.</li>
			<li><b>Step 3: Cook.</b> For stovetop, allow it to come to a boil before lowering the heat to a simmer. For slow cooker, transfer the mixture to a slow cooker, add water and mix to combine.</li>
			<li><b>Step 4: Thicken.</b>If you try to thicken the gravy by adding in flour, it will result in clumps. To avoid this, remove some of the nihari liquid (I always found using water dilutes the taste) and allow it to cool. Then stir it into the atta flour. Add this slurry to the nihari while stirring to prevent clumps. Allow this to cook and thicken.</li>
