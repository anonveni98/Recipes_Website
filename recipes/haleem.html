			<h2>Haleem Recipe</h2>
			<h1>WHAT IS HALEEM?</h1>
			<p>
				Haleem (also called daleem, halim, etc.) is a Pakistani, Indian and/or Hyderabadi thick stew made with various grains, lentils (dal/daal), and meat.
				<br>Traditionally, each component is cooked separately, then mixed together and slow-cooked to achieve the thick and luscious texture. <br>The resulting interwoven or ‘laced’ consistency is Haleem’s distinguishing feature.
			</p>
			<h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
			<p>While this recipe calls for several ingredients, all of them are readily available at most Indian and Pakistani grocery stores.</p>

			<h1>HOW TO MAKE Haleem</h1>
				<ul>
				<li><b>Step 1:</b>Soak grains and lentils. Sauté onions, garlic, and ginger. Add the meat, sauté for a bit, then add the rest of the IP ingredients and pressure cook with the Meat/Stew Setting.</li>
				<li><b>Step 2:</b> Open the Pot. Remove the beef and give it just enough pulses in the food processor to shred. Then use an immersion blender to blend the lentils & grains. If you don’t have an immersion blender, run the lentils and grains through the food processor too.</li>
				<li><b>Step 3:</b> Add oats and cook the haleem down. Once it starts bubbling, cover and slow cook until you can see the ‘laced’ consistency (or resha). If you’re up for it, make a tadka. Garnish and serve!</li>
			</ul>
